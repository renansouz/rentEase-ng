# RentEase 🏡

**RentEase** is a single-page Progressive Web App (PWA) built with Angular and Firebase that streamlines the process of finding and listing rental properties. Landlords can publish and manage flats; renters can search, favorite, and chat in real time, all in a responsive, mobile-first interface powered by Tailwind CSS.

## 🎯 Development Patterns

- Standalone Components with imports: [...] rather than NgModule declarations
- Reactive Forms (FormBuilder, Validators) for all inputs
- Firestore Queries optimized with where, orderBy & Indexed composite queries
- Angular Material for accessible, consistent UI elements
- Tailwind CSS for rapid utility-first styling and responsive breakpoints
